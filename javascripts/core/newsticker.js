["So I've pondered this question for a long time. Antimatter Dimensions... what does it mean? I mean it's game, that's clear. You buy the first dimension, and it gives you antimatter, and the second dimension provides more first dimensions and so on... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems too plain for that. The developer must have made it as a metaphor. I was doing my weekly ritual of using the fingernail clipper to cut my pubic hair, when finally the realization came to me. The dimensions are just thinly veiled misspellings of the word 'depression'. Regular matter are the cruel and negative thoughts that add to and fuel depression, while antimatter is the positive thoughts and good friends that dispel it You start off with something simple, and it fights almost imperceptibly against the depression, but as you keep going the fight builds. But it never seems to fix everything. The depression seems like it could go on to infinity. So you keep going. But eventually, you figure out, depression isn't infinite. It's just very very large. But your 'dimensions' eventually, with enough work, make enough 'antimatter' to usurp that seeming infinity of depression. Then the possibilities are endless. You are actually happy for once, and your happiness grows exponentially as you go beyond and seemingly 'break' the 'infinity' of depression. And you go on until that 'infinity' seems tiny in comparison to the happiness you've managed to achieve in your life, where if you reset you get over that infinity in less than the blink of an eye. If you want to know what the multiple layers of prestige are...'Dimensional Shifts' are getting new things and methods to give you happiness. 'Dimensional Boosts' are upgrading the things and methods. Examples would be getting a new car being a 'Dimensional Shift' and trading that car in for a new one would be a 'Dimensional Boost'. 'Eternities' are major tragedies such as a loved one dying. That lapse brings you straight back to the beginning, with seemingly no hope of return. But with time, you grow back stronger and happier than ever before. 'Dimensional Sacrifice' is moving away. You have to give up a lot of the things you had that made you happy, but there is new opportunity in where you move to. And that new opportunity gives you more happiness than you ever had. 'Tickspeed' is how easy it is to make you happy, and 'Time Dimensions' make it even easier to be happy. Antimatter Dimensions is a metaphor for a depressed man's successful battle against his illness.",true ,"a112"],

All who have researched it have eventually died the same way, so it is impossible to tell exactly, but this is the common belief. Regardless, with the introduction of 'cancer' mode, as well as reports of it's spontaneous appearance, sufficient repetition of this mode's appearance may lead to	an image forming in the mind similar to 'Fractal Cancer Type III'.

["Antimatter dimensions is a metaphor for communism. There is only one source of production doing all the work, AKA first dimensions, while everyone else shares the antimatter. But wait, does that mean matter is always capitalistic? That can't be true, considering that the soviets were communists, and they were made of matter. Wat, maybe they was'nt? Antimatter dimensions takes place inside the soviet union confirmed? That means the soviet union still exists, because if it does'nt, then that means it's physically impossible for antimatter dimensions to exist? But the soviet unions does'nt exist, wich means antimatterr dimensions should'nt exist. This means the universe cannot exist, because there is a paradox, but the universe DOES exist, so it can't be a paradox, there has to be some other solution. Wait, the first word of the soviet anthem is \"Soyuz\", wich means \"Union\", in english. This could mean that the antimatter dimensions are actually in union with the time BEFORE 1991, but it still exists today. Antimatter dimensions hjas confirmed that time travel is possible. Hevipelle, please show us your secret. He's probably not gonna answer, because he is technically Stalin. \"Hevipelle\", is just the project name of Stalins top secret time travel machine. Stalin then went into the machine, and tried to hide in the least popular game genre, incremental games. Stalin then decided to make an further lie by saying he's finnish. It all makes sense now! The communist dimensions and the complete dictatorship of the player. Now, you might be wondering why Stalin still existed after the time travel_. Well, the only possibility is that the time travel machine somehow moved into a timeline where he never used it. But wait, this means that Stalin never actually used the time machine. Yet another paradox! Well, this one is quite explainable. You see, there are 5 timelines. The first one, where Stalin didd use the time machine, but antimatter dimensions never existed, the second one where he did'nt use the time machine, but he still existed in the present, there is also a third one where he made a timeline union, wich connected the first and second timeline through yet another machine. There is also the 4th, where he has taken over the univerese and it's where he does most of his stuff. There is also the final and 5th one, the timeline where antimatter dimensions is happening. Tgis means that both timeline 1,2 and 5 are crossingg each other, while the third are combining them. This means i should be able to enter into the second timeline wich makes it so i can get a time machine to reach into the 4th timeline. 5 hours later and i have finally gotten into the 4th timeline, where i met face to face with Stalin himself. He looked very strong and he saw me. He immedeatly tried to talk to me and we camÃ© to the conclusion that we needed more of a crew. We went to get some help from Vladimir Putin, who quickly went under the alias of \"Aarex\", who made a 6th timeline wich is ng+++. However, Stalin got so afraid of the quality of Putins content, so he got a meantal illness. But he had one final wish. To create the \"Reality\" update, wich would end the antimatter dimensions timeline. But putin was trying to make a reworked version of ng+++. This meant creating a 7th timeline. Howeverr, i also wanted to do something. I created the \"NG+1e308\" timeline, but it ended before it even started. However, everythhing was going great until Slabdrill found us and tried to attack us. We quickly trapped him inside a ninth timeline. From there he made countless attempts of addeing his timeline into another timeline i the forrm of a ninth dimension, but Putin did nott let him. The wall between the ninth timeline and the rest was just too strong.	However, you might be wondering how you too can gain access to all of this, well, at firtrst you need t-		(Gets shot by Stalin) the AD:NGA mod, the 10th timeline with a fractal engine inspired mechanic and Rhendevous relics, you need 20 Rhendevous resets to get the 20-relic, a inter-timeline transport device with the Buy-N-Large logo, the 15-relic is a Buy-N-Large time machine.", true, "am222"],
